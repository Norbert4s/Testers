getting and displaying a list of users from API

Using:
Vue.js from CDN - my personal choice for super small projects,
SASS,
Simple-grid - random backbones grid(http://thisisdallas.github.io/Simple-Grid/)
axios - for getting API

Could've used babel and polyfill, but didn't thought it was worth for such a small project with so few lines of javascript.
Surprisingly async/await is kinda slow, but I didn't see a better way of writing it.
